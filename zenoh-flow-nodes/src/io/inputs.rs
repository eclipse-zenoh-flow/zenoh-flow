/// The `Inputs` structure contains all the inputs created for a [Sink](crate::prelude::Sink) or an
/// [Operator](crate::prelude::Operator).
///
/// Each input is indexed by its **port identifier**: the name that was indicated in the descriptor
/// of the node. These names are _case sensitive_ and should be an exact match to what was written
/// in the descriptor.
///
/// Zenoh-Flow provides two flavors of input: [InputRaw] and [`Input<T>`]. An [`Input<T>`]
/// conveniently exposes instances of `T` while an [InputRaw] exposes messages, allowing to
/// disregard the contained data.
///
/// The main way to interact with `Inputs` is through the `take` method.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// let input_builder = inputs.take("test raw").expect("No input name 'test raw' found");
/// let input_raw = input_builder.raw();
///
/// let input_builder = inputs.take("test typed").expect("No input name 'test typed' found");

///                             |bytes| serde_json::from_slice(bytes)
