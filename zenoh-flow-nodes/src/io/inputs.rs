/// The `Inputs` structure contains all the inputs created for a [Sink](crate::prelude::Sink) or an
/// [Operator](crate::prelude::Operator).
///
/// Each input is indexed by its **port identifier**: the name that was indicated in the descriptor
/// of the node. These names are _case sensitive_ and should be an exact match to what was written
/// in the descriptor.
///
/// Zenoh-Flow provides two flavours of input: [InputRaw] and [`Input<T>`]. An [`Input<T>`]
/// conveniently exposes instances of `T` while an [InputRaw] exposes messages, allowing to
/// disregard the contained data.
///
/// The main way to interact with `Inputs` is through the `take` method.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use zenoh_flow_nodes::prelude::*;
/// # let mut inputs = Inputs::default();
/// let input_raw = inputs.take("test raw")
///     .expect("No input name 'test raw' found")
///     .raw();
///
