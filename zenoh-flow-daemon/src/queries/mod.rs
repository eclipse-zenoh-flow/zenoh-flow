//! Queries and their response to interact with a Zenoh-Flow [Daemon].

//! This module exposes the available queries to manage data flow instances and interact with other Zenoh-Flow Daemons.
//! The queries are divided into two sets:
//! - [instances](InstancesQuery)
//! - [runtime](RuntimesQuery)
//!
//! [Daemon]: crate::daemon::Daemon
