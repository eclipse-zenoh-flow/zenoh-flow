/// An `OperatorDescriptor` uniquely identifies and configures an Operator.
///
/// Zenoh-Flow supports several ways of declaring a Operator:
/// - by importing a "remote" descriptor (e.g. located in another descriptor file),
/// - with an inline declaration.
///
/// It is not possible to define an `Operator` inside your code base. This structure was made to be parsed from a
/// configuration file. You should instead use a [FlattenedOperatorDescriptor](crate::FlattenedOperatorDescriptor).
///
/// # Remote descriptor: composite or custom
///
/// Specifying a remote descriptor allows including a [CompositeOperatorDescriptor](crate::CompositeOperatorDescriptor):
/// the composition of several Operators.
///
/// Manually describing a composite operator is not supported as it defeats its primary purpose: simplifying the
/// creation of a data flow.
///
/// # ⚠️ Caveat: `NodeId` and `PortId`
///
/// Zenoh-Flow identifiers cannot contain certain special characters as it could prevent creating valid Zenoh
/// key-expressions. The list can be found [here](zenoh_flow_commons::deserialize_id).
///
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Remote descriptor
///
/// ⚠️ For now only the `file://` schema is supported. We are planning to support other protocols in future releases of
/// Zenoh-Flow.
///
/// ```yaml
/// id: my-operator-1
/// descriptor: file:///home/zenoh-flow/my-operator.yaml
/// configuration:
///   answer: 1
/// ```
///
/// With the file at `/home/zenoh-flow/my-operator.yaml` containing:
/// ```yaml
/// description: This is my Operator
/// library: file:///home/zenoh-flow/libmy_operator.so
/// inputs:
///   - in-1
/// outputs:
///   - out-1
/// ```
///
/// ## Inline declaration: custom operator
///
/// ```yaml
/// id: my-operator-1
/// description: This is my Operator
/// library: file:///home/zenoh-flow/libmy_operator.so
/// inputs:
///   - in-1
/// outputs:
///   - out-1
/// configuration:
///   answer: 1
/// ```
